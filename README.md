# Masters's Thesis
This is my Master's Thesis for the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Digital Imaging.

## Abstract
The progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence has led us to a new research
era. Deep Learning models can automatically detect and diagnose diseases in pa-
tients. In this project, Deep Learning techniques are applied to several use cases
related to health. Neural Networks are used to build models which are able to
face the different tasks in each use case. The tasks presented in this work are re-
lated to the analysis of electroencephalogram signals and medical imaging. The
project was carried out under the development of the EDDL toolkit, a software
that allows for creating and manipulating the mentioned models. The main goal
is to use this toolkit to face machine learning problems with state-of-the-art mod-
els.
